Ron: So, this is the inn?
Clair: Should be...
Miss Tera Msue: Hello, I’m Ms. Tera M’Sue. I assume that you two Syd Clair and Chev Ron?
Clair: ... how do you know?
Miss Tera Msue: We don’t get visitors here, almost ever. I’m very glad about the change! Let me know if you need anything during your stay.
Ron: Is there anywhere in town where there would be a lot of people to talk to about the strange weather?
Miss Tera Msue: Yes, the bar tends to have quite a few people at this time of day. Be careful though, people here can be wary of outsiders in a town this small.
