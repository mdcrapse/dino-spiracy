Clair: Hello there, have you noticed any differences in the weather?
Dino Guy: Oh yeah, it’s HOT.
Clair: ... can you elaborate?
Dino Guy: I used to grow flowers for my wife, but it’s so hot that they have been wilting in the ground..
Dino Guy: I must paint them for her now, hopefully one day she’ll understand that I’m painting flowers.
