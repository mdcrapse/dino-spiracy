Ron: Ahh, well rested and ready to start today!
Clair: Agreed. Though, we did already talk to everyone in town...
Miss Tera Msue: Have you gone to the lake yet?
Clair: What lake?
Miss Tera Msue: The one just outside of town. Our fishermen live there and might be able to give a new perspective..
Ron!: That sounds like a lead!
